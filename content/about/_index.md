關於 / About
  
曾锐折...的作品大多使用紙張銜接、黏合、包覆異材質、來自不同脈絡的物件，這些物件可能是破碎的日常生活物件，故障的家電、機械；大量製造、輪廓模糊的裝飾品、塑膠玩具，甚至是被棄置的皮毛、標本等等。

紙這項媒材在他的使用中，多是以平面之外的狀態作為出發，嘗試透過這樣的作品來回應日常生活中人們習以為常，但其實存在許多隱而不現的怪異或不平衡，甚至威權遺緒。

  
Chang Jui-che’s works predominantly employ paper to connect, bind, or envelop heterogeneous materials and objects drawn from diverse contexts. These objects may include fragmented items from daily life—malfunctioning appliances and machines; mass-produced, indistinct decorations and plastic toys; or even discarded hides and taxidermy specimens. In his practice, paper functions not merely as a flat surface but as a material that departs from flatness.

Through such works, Chang seeks to address the latent strangeness, imbalance, and lingering traces of authoritarianism that underlie the seemingly ordinary aspects of everyday life.
