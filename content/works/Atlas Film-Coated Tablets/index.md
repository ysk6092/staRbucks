如何讓阿特拉斯撐起世界？也許只要讓他做伏地挺身就好。 在一個人們放棄進行生產的世界裡，阿特拉斯得以從肩扛世界的刑罰中逃脫。 我們身邊有許多關於阿特拉斯的名稱殘留的痕跡，比如大西洋或亞特蘭提斯。法爾內塞的阿特拉斯（ Farnese Atlas）則是可能現存最古老的阿拉斯像，這具雕像刻畫了舉著天球的擎天神。 本作品通過反覆充氣一具法爾內塞的阿特拉斯像的低畫質複製品，使得複製品表層的圖像被擠壓、變形， 露出帶有抗拒情緒但隱忍的表情；這具複製品身上一處原版的阿特拉斯像照片也在不斷屈伸的過程中， 時而與地板化為一部份，時而又以與照片內容迥異的方式矗立於地面。 這尊充氣雕像表層的圖像選用手機中儲存或照相來製作，其中大致位於充氣雕像頭部位置的圖像則使用 圖片中出現的臉孔來合成，這代表了臉孔的長相會無限趨近於出現頻率最高的臉，這張臉的功能上較像 用以輔助立體建立的指示圖或賦形劑，作者在日常在遺忘中剩餘的部分，只能被觀者以模糊的方式指認， 卻是這樣介於平面與立體之間的觀看方式的混成，使解讀有了新的可能。 而阿特拉斯像手中支撐的世界（天球）也被移植到下半身，投入硬幣時才會裝模作樣的表現出舉起什麼的 樣子。用像素代替生產的態度底下，光澤感提供了蝸牛表皮一般的觸感，像是成藥的膜衣，用光滑的外表 盛裝內在粉狀濃縮的價值觀，以最節省時間的態度建立一個立足於風中飄盪的傳單上，只出現在耳語傳 聞之中世界。 製作時我的想像主要圍繞兩件事，一是關於描述如何以某種簡化或抽象的方法建立認識，二是這種方法 在世界中何以成立。 

How might Atlas be made to hold up the world? Perhaps it is enough to have him do push-ups. In a world where people have abandoned production, Atlas is released from the punishment of bearing the world on his shoulders.

Traces of Atlas remain all around us—in names such as the Atlantic Ocean or Atlantis. The Farnese Atlas is believed to be the oldest surviving sculptural representation of Atlas, depicting the Titan holding up the celestial sphere. This work repeatedly inflates a low-resolution replica of the Farnese Atlas, causing the image on its surface to be compressed and deformed. Through this process, an expression of resistance tempered by restraint gradually emerges. A photograph of the original Farnese Atlas, printed on the replica’s body, is also subjected to continuous bending and stretching: at times it merges with the floor, at others it rises from the ground in a form that contradicts the image it depicts.

The surface imagery of the inflatable sculpture is composed of images stored or photographed on a mobile phone. Around the area corresponding to the head, facial images are composited using faces extracted from these pictures. This suggests a face that increasingly converges toward the most frequently appearing one—a face that functions less as an identity than as a formative aid, comparable to a guide image or an excipient used to stabilize a three-dimensional form. What remains of the artist’s daily life, filtered through forgetting, can only be recognized by the viewer in a blurred manner. Yet it is precisely this hybrid mode of viewing—suspended between flatness and volume—that opens new possibilities of interpretation.

The “world” supported by Atlas—the celestial sphere—is displaced to the lower half of the body, where it performs the gesture of lifting only when a coin is inserted. Under an attitude that replaces production with pixels, gloss becomes tactile, resembling the surface of a snail’s skin. Like the coating of a pharmaceutical tablet, a smooth exterior encloses a powdered, condensed set of values within. With maximum efficiency and minimal time, a world is constructed—one that stands on leaflets drifting in the wind, existing only through whispers and circulation.

My imagination during the making of this work revolved around two questions: first, how forms of knowledge are established through simplification or abstraction; and second, how such methods come to operate—and gain validity—within the world.
