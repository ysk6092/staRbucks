透過「壓縮」與「重現」這兩種模式，探討人類如何感知和儲存現實中的資訊，同時揭示文明發展與自然環境之間的衝突。一方面，我收集路上遭到車輛輾過的動物屍體，這些被壓得扁平的動物，如同被車輪這個壓印機器製造的版畫般，成為了自然生命在文明路徑中的殘留印記。
另一方面，我收集網路上流傳的低畫質廣告圖像，這些影像通常失真、模糊，從大尺寸的原始檔案，經過二、三次調整成不同尺寸的複製貼上後，細節已被擴散的馬賽克紋理取代，圖像結構充滿了遭到壓縮後遺留的痕跡，成為某種弱影像的狀態。我將這些低解析度的圖像轉化為作品，試圖以人為的方式再現這些遭到路殺的動物生前的姿態。這一過程反映了人類在資訊時代中的重現行為，即透過想像或拼湊，試圖復原已不可得的原初狀態，建構一種對真實的模擬或再現。這些重現的圖像是經過多次轉譯和扭曲的結果，無法真正還原現實。

這兩種方式一同構成了作品的對比。動物屍體代表的是生命經過人為因素壓縮後的物質殘留，展現了現實中的直接介入；而低畫質的再現圖像則象徵人類對於原始記憶的執念，以拼湊和修復的方式試圖「接近真實」。這兩者相互交錯，呼應了文明在技術與資源的取用中，如何重新建構自然，但最終卻始終無法達到真正的回溯或復原。

這件作品誕生於某種無意識的收集：那些被遺落在馬路上的動物屍體，原本只是日常移動中的雜訊——一種難以正視也無從處理的視覺汙點。它們不是具有象徵意涵的圖像，也不是政治論述的素材，而是某種經過壓縮後的現實，在地面上留下的紙頁般殘軀，輕盈暨沉重。作品試圖從這些「壓縮的存在」出發，不是為了修補記憶，而是承認記憶本身的不完整與扭曲。

Through the dual modes of compression and reproduction, this work examines how humans perceive and store information from reality, while exposing the tensions between the development of civilization and the natural environment. On one hand, I collect the bodies of animals run over by vehicles. Flattened by impact, these animals resemble prints unintentionally produced by the wheel as a stamping machine, becoming residual imprints of natural life along the paths of civilization.

On the other hand, I gather low-resolution advertising images circulating online. These images are often distorted and blurred: originally large files that, after being resized and copied two or three times, lose their details to expanded mosaic textures. Their structures bear the scars of compression, entering a condition I describe as weak images. I translate these low-resolution images into physical works, attempting—through artificial means—to reconstruct the animals’ postures before being killed on the road. This process mirrors acts of reproduction in the information age, where imagination and assemblage are used to approximate an irretrievable origin, constructing simulations of the real. Yet these reproduced images, shaped by repeated translation and distortion, can never truly restore reality.

Together, these two approaches form the central contrast of the work. The animal corpses represent the material residue of life compressed by human intervention—direct evidence of contact with reality. The low-resolution reproductions, by contrast, symbolize humanity’s fixation on original memory and its desire to “approach the real” through repair and recomposition. Intertwined, they reveal how civilization continually reconstructs nature through technology and resource extraction, while remaining unable to achieve genuine recovery or return.

The work originates in an unconscious act of collecting. The animal bodies left on the road were once mere noise within daily movement—visual blemishes that were difficult to confront or process. They are neither symbolic images nor political materials, but compressed reality itself: paper-like remnants pressed into the ground, both light and heavy. Beginning from these “compressed existences,” the work does not seek to mend memory, but to acknowledge its inherent fragmentation and distortion.
