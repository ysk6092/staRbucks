這是一件來自勞動記憶的作品，也是一件關於體制內部消化與清除機制的作品，有時我會想像便利商店是一座被修剪、氣味經過處理的溫室雨林。它有著恆溫、清潔、光線均勻的頂層，規格化的植物——也就是一排排分門別類、塑膠膜封裝的食品。走進其中，人們往往被包裝上食物的色澤吸引，就像熱帶鳥類飛向果實。那些看起來完美的商品，在日期交替之際，成為每天得費時處理的廢棄物，一種逆向的勞動果實。拆封、倒棄、擦拭、回收，這一桶桶廚餘，曾是被分隔、精心鋪排的料理；秩序在回收的過程中被抽離，料理歸復為食材，再化為純粹的、渾沌的熱量。而容器像是骸骨、遺跡，呈現曾經存在的秩序。這種勞動讓我開始懷疑：這些產品究竟意在生產食物，還是生產廢棄物？


This work arises from memories of labor and focuses on the internal mechanisms of digestion and disposal within an institutional system. I sometimes imagine the convenience store as a carefully pruned, odor-regulated greenhouse rainforest: a space of constant temperature, cleanliness, and evenly distributed light, filled with standardized “plants”—rows of neatly categorized foods sealed in plastic packaging. As people enter, they are drawn to the colors of the food on display, much like tropical birds attracted to fruit.

Yet these seemingly perfect products inevitably become waste as expiration dates turn, forming a reversed harvest of labor that must be processed every day. Unsealing, discarding, wiping, recycling—bucket after bucket of kitchen waste that was once carefully separated and meticulously arranged as meals. Through the act of disposal, order is gradually stripped away: dishes revert to ingredients, then dissolve into pure, undifferentiated calories. The containers remain like bones or ruins, preserving traces of a former system of order. This repetitive labor led me to question whether these products are ultimately meant to produce food—or to produce waste.
