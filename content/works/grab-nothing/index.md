當我發現的時候，街角空下的店面已經逐漸被夾娃娃機店取代了，夜裡，這些原本緊閉的鐵門，被無人商店光亮的夾娃娃機們填滿，這些機器歡騰的光線與展示櫥窗裡廉價而五彩斑斕的商品們，與店外的黑格格不入，那透到街上的光像是愛德華霍普的畫作夜游者裡描繪的一樣，與夜半的空氣一起傳遞著孤獨與荒謬，這些機械不分晝夜永不休息的迎接著偶爾駐足的過客。

回應這樣的景象，我選擇使用紙來製作一台可操作的夾娃娃機，這台機器的櫥窗玻璃隱約呈現著一張臉的輪廓；而在這張模糊的臉孔之下，內部是一個由平面繪畫邏輯一般構成的世界，充滿色彩與筆觸。而不論在機器的內外，彷彿是將原先存在於內部的商品們消化、吐出、與自身融合一樣，四處都充滿著塑膠玩具的部分形體。這些特徵使得觀看這部機械並不僅限使用觀看雕塑的方法，觀者必需在嘗試貼近、操作互動、觀察輪廓之間游移，我希望在這樣的過程中，觀者能夠映照出自身的處境。



By the time I began to notice them, vacant storefronts on street corners were already being replaced by claw machine arcades. At night, the metal shutters that once sealed these spaces were filled instead by the glow of unmanned machines. Their exuberant lights and the cheap, brightly colored prizes displayed behind glass stood in stark contrast to the surrounding darkness. The light spilling onto the street recalled Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, carrying a sense of solitude and absurdity into the midnight air. These machines operate ceaselessly, day and night, mechanically welcoming the occasional passerby.

In response to this urban scene, I chose to construct a fully operable claw machine out of paper. The display window of the machine faintly reveals the contour of a human face; beneath this blurred visage lies an interior structured according to the logic of painting, filled with color and painterly gestures. Both inside and outside the machine, fragments of plastic toys appear as if the prizes once contained within have been digested, expelled, and fused with the machine’s own body. These qualities prevent the work from being approached solely as a sculpture. The viewer must shift between proximity, interaction, and observation—leaning in, operating the machine, tracing its contours. Through this oscillating process, I hope the viewer may come to reflect on their own position within the scene.
