這是一台自製的快照機。相較原版，不再是一組以功能為核心的機械體系，而是一種過度裝飾、拼貼與表徵的視覺機構。膠帶、現成物、紙材與發光體交織其上，構成一個既似機台、又非機台的複合體。觀者被吸引靠近，卻發現自己置身於一個錯置的觀看場域：熟悉與陌生、可識別與無從命名交錯並存。

這樣的操作，其實也可以被視為一種繪畫問題在空間中的延伸。這些裝置中的紙質結構與材質處理，不再只是雕塑或建構材料，而是一種平面性的轉譯策略：我將原屬繪畫的表面操作拉伸、扭曲、折疊至三維空間，使它既非繪畫，也無法完全成為功能性物件。在畫布之外，回應繪畫作為一種歷史性媒介在當代表面文化中的殘存與位移。



This work takes the form of a self-made snapshot machine. In contrast to its original version, it is no longer a mechanical system centered on function, but an excessively ornamented, collaged, and signifying visual apparatus. Tape, found objects, paper, and luminous elements are interwoven across its surface, forming a hybrid structure that resembles a machine yet never fully becomes one. Viewers are drawn toward it, only to find themselves placed within a dislocated field of vision where the familiar and the strange, the recognizable and the unnameable, coexist.

This approach can also be understood as a spatial extension of a painterly problem. The paper structures and material treatments in the installation are not merely sculptural or constructive materials, but strategies for translating flatness into space. I stretch, twist, and fold the surface operations of painting into three-dimensional form, producing an object that is neither painting nor a fully functional device. Situated beyond the canvas, the work responds to the persistence and displacement of painting as a historical medium within contemporary surface culture.
