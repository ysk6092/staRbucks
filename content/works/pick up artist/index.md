Pickup artist，簡稱PUA，原指搭訕熟手、調情聖手，直譯為：拾取藝術家。拾取物現成物件在創作上進行引用的方法，往往透過遷移這些拾得物的場域，或錯誤連結這些拾得物來產生新的意義，這與搭訕熟手技巧性的利用資訊不對等，來操縱他人心理的狀態多少有些類似。 在這件作品中，機車與其模型構成了一種對照： 原始的機車有如臺座，其呈現的修補是為了使其繼續運轉所產生的痕跡。附著在其之上的模型，複製了這些修補的痕跡之外，也因為在數位與現實中轉換的落差，而產生新的修補痕跡。 機車與模型如同忒休斯之船與其在水面上的倒影；兩者產生的修補痕跡，則如同水面的波紋與船體修補的痕跡，分別承載並標誌了現實的替換與資訊的拼湊，卻都在質疑物質世界的同一性界限。 當真實物件與數位模型以倒影一般的姿態出現時，觀者所面對的，不只是物與擬像的對照，而是一個不斷被修補、更新、替換的存在狀態。 「拾取」因此不再只是回收與再利用的行為，而是一種關於當代生存的隱喻：我們不斷撿拾、拼湊、修補自身在資訊與現實之間的斷裂，以殘片構築新的「現實」，如同在一艘不斷被更換的船上繼續航行，卻再也無法指認它的起點。

The term pickup artist—commonly abbreviated as PUA—originally refers to someone skilled in initiating conversations and flirtation; literally translated, it means a “picker” or “collector.” In artistic practice, the use of found objects often operates through similar strategies: by relocating these picked-up materials into new contexts, or by misconnecting them, artists generate new meanings. This bears a certain resemblance to the tactics of pickup artists, who skillfully exploit asymmetries of information to influence and manipulate others’ psychological states.

In this work, a motorcycle and its model form a deliberate contrast. The original motorcycle functions like a pedestal, its visible repairs marking the traces of interventions made simply to keep it running. The model attached to it not only reproduces these repair marks, but also accumulates new ones—generated through the gaps and slippages that occur in the translation between the digital and the physical.

The motorcycle and its model resemble the Ship of Theseus and its reflection on the water’s surface. Their respective repair traces are like the ripples on the water and the patches on the hull: each records a different kind of substitution—one in material reality, the other in informational assembly—while both call into question the boundaries of identity in the material world.

When the physical object and its digital model appear in a relationship akin to reflection, the viewer is confronted not merely with a comparison between object and simulacrum, but with a state of existence defined by continuous repair, updating, and replacement.

“Picking up,” therefore, is no longer simply an act of recycling or reuse, but becomes a metaphor for contemporary existence. We constantly collect fragments, assemble and repair the ruptures between information and reality, constructing new versions of the “real” from remnants—continuing to sail on a ship whose parts are endlessly replaced, while its point of origin can no longer be identified.
