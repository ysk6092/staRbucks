這件裝置通過錯誤的連接回收玩具的電路，來製造奇異的聲光效果。在裝置的外部，放大到無法辨認原始內容的影像，構成宛如皮膚般，光滑的呈現著粗糙的外殼。在構造上，這具裝置通過投幣功德箱來驅動，當展期結束，作者將會在野外釋放與硬幣數量相等的蟋蟀。蟋蟀通常做為寵物的飼料被交易；在這裡，蟋蟀更像是一種貨幣，去購買原不屬於己身的自由。透過這層機制，裝置有如一具生命體，不單只是影像構成的外殼與電路、馬達之間，有如皮膚、神經、肌肉的關係，而是在回收物、影像、空間外，被視為無足輕重的生命之間平行卻交織的關係。
在這關係之中，生命的尺度被以廉價和扁平的方式量化，將一種道德上的危機拋向觀眾。透過作品機制的循環探索在當代社會中人類如何與技術、自然互動並推進關於生命的思考。



This installation generates uncanny sound and light effects by deliberately misconnecting the recycled circuits of discarded toys. On its exterior, images are enlarged to the point where their original content becomes unrecognizable, forming a smooth, skin-like surface that nonetheless reveals a coarse shell beneath. Structurally, the device is activated through a coin-operated donation box. At the end of the exhibition, the artist will release into the wild a number of crickets equal to the coins collected.

Crickets are typically traded as feed for pets; here, however, they function more like a form of currency—used to purchase a freedom that does not originally belong to them. Through this mechanism, the installation takes on the qualities of a living organism. It is not only a relationship between an image-based оболshell and circuits or motors—akin to skin, nerves, and muscles—but also a parallel and intertwined system that extends beyond the object itself, linking recycled materials, images, space, and forms of life usually regarded as negligible.

Within this network, life is quantified in a cheap and flattened manner, confronting the viewer with an ethical dilemma. By cycling through its own mechanisms, the work probes how contemporary society negotiates relationships between humans, technology, and nature, and pushes forward a reflection on the value and conditions of life itself.
