每個人的臉孔，只要轉到特定的角度，簡直與他周遭的物品毫無分別，就像排列整齊的商品在貨架上，並非形狀的相似，而是形象、風格或是顏色的重疊，與虛空裡的邊界重疊，他們手牽手組成巨大的布幔圍牆樹木樓房，像海嘯山崩隕石落雷一樣朝我坍塌壓下，冰系加龍系是弱點是會被妖精系四倍克制，而且打點並不廣。但我繼續讓事情運轉，把前人的發明按照佔據的空間大小分類排序，將他們的外觀及性能進行評比，把數字的大小跟亮度調整一致，使懶惰的富裕人士能使用寶貴的每一秒來為自己的孩子鋪好前往廁所的道路。他們需要尿布。

Every face, once turned to a certain angle, becomes almost indistinguishable from the objects around it—like neatly arranged products on a store shelf. It is not a resemblance of form, but an overlap of image, style, or color, merging with the boundaries of emptiness itself. Hand in hand, they form vast curtain-walls of people, trees, and buildings, collapsing toward me like a tsunami, a landslide, a meteor strike, a bolt of lightning.

Ice-type combined with Dragon-type is a weakness—four times vulnerable to Fairy-type, with limited coverage. Still, I keep things running. I sort the inventions of those before me by the amount of space they occupy, compare their appearances and functions, and standardize numbers and brightness so that the lazily affluent can spend every precious second paving a clear path to the bathroom for their children. They need diapers.
