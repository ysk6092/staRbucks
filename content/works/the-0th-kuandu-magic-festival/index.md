我使用紙製作了一尊台灣歷史上著名的獨裁者蔣介石的紙製塑像，並邀請道士陳柏瑜為其進行招魂的儀式。儀式完成後，我邀請兩名在台灣廟會上表演的舞者，在塑像面前完成一段舞蹈，就像台灣傳統儀式裡，表演給神明看的表演一樣。
儘管蔣介石在台灣進行了多年的白色恐怖統治，但如今台灣民眾仍普遍對其過去的作為並無太明確的認識，並對其形象仍存在貨幣之上亦大多沒有太多感觸。
在嘲諷蔣介石的威權遺緒仍如幽魂一般繚繞在台灣之外，這件作品不單是對宗教儀式的模仿，而是對權力關係如何透過「儀式」這件事潛入日常的一次檢測。




I created a paper effigy of Chiang Kai-shek, one of the most prominent dictators in Taiwan’s history, and invited the Taoist priest Chen Po-Yu to conduct a soul-calling ritual for it. After the ritual, I asked two dancers who perform in Taiwanese temple festivals to dance in front of the effigy, echoing the performances traditionally offered to deities during religious ceremonies.

Although Chiang Kai-shek presided over decades of White Terror in Taiwan, public understanding of his actions today remains vague. His image continues to circulate—most notably on currency—yet it often provokes little emotional response. By satirizing the way his authoritarian legacy still lingers like a ghost beyond Taiwan’s historical reckoning, this work is not simply a reenactment of religious ritual. Rather, it examines how power relations infiltrate everyday life through the structure and repetition of ritual itself.
