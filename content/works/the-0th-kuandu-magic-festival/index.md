使用紙製作了一尊蔣介石的塑像，並邀請道士陳柏瑜為其進行招魂、開光的儀式。儀式完成後，邀請兩名在台灣廟會上表演的舞者，在塑像面前完成一段舞蹈，就像台灣傳統儀式裡的酬神賽會一般。
儘管蔣介石在台灣進行了多年的白色恐怖統治，但如今其形象仍有如某種聖像，恐懼、崇敬，這些情緒深深滲入被殖民殘餘的記憶之中。
在指出威權遺緒仍如幽魂一般繚繞在台灣之外，這件作品不單是對宗教儀式的模仿，而是對權力關係如何透過「儀式」這件事潛入日常的一次檢測。




I created a paper effigy of Chiang Kai-shek and invited the Taoist priest Chen Po-Yu to perform rituals of soul-calling and consecration. After the rituals were completed, I invited two dancers who perform in Taiwanese temple festivals to dance in front of the effigy, in a manner resembling traditional chou-shen ceremonies—performances offered to deities as acts of devotion.

Although Chiang Kai-shek imposed decades of White Terror in Taiwan, his image today still functions like a kind of icon. Feelings of fear and reverence remain deeply embedded in memories shaped by the residues of colonial and authoritarian rule. By pointing to the way this authoritarian legacy continues to linger like a ghost around Taiwan, the work is not merely an imitation of religious ritual. Rather, it examines how power relations infiltrate everyday life through the structure and repetition of ritual itself.
