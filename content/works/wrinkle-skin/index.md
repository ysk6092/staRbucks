.從那裏看來，確實應該要發生點什麼了。跟太陽下山後的紅豆色天空不同，聲音彼此相隔遙遠聲音的在周圍，讓人確定是晚上的晚上。 稍微稀薄的空氣，橋梁連接著兩面山壁，底下一條車道夾在兩面山壁之間，形成兩面包夾之勢，偶爾有一兩輛車經過，發出遙遠的摩擦或碰撞聲。 碩！大！駕駛員彈起，椅背後的明天追趕而來，屁股跟著路燈照進車窗的閃爍一起忽高忽低，除了從橋下穿過這一刻，兩者因為地形產生的交疊之外，他與現在這個時刻毫無共通點，事實上他與車殼之外的任何事物都不相關，與他最接近相關的是另外一端，那棟民宅裡人們剛關上客廳的燈。家裡的人們都厭惡他在深夜開門，傾軋來回的鐵門聲響日復一日，這些無形責難在隔天清晨醒來，移動，存活在移動之上朝另一個地方移動，像是橋梁，一座用橋梁做成的橋樑。他膝蓋痠痛步上／步下四樓，每一次階梯傳遞的震動都像輪胎躍過柏油路傳到他的肩膀，他與自己也並不相關。這樣的駕駛有一天跟橋上的此刻在同一個平面相遇了，應該首先會對他們的移動方式感到全然的陌生吧？

From that vantage point, it truly felt as though something ought to happen. Unlike the red-bean–colored sky at sunset, the sounds here were scattered far apart, echoing around the space and confirming that this was night in its deepest sense.

The air was slightly thin. A bridge connected two cliff faces, and below it a roadway was wedged tightly between them, forming a kind of double enclosure. Occasionally, one or two cars passed through, releasing distant sounds of friction or impact.

Bang! Crash! The driver jolted upright. Tomorrow, from behind the seatback, seemed to rush toward him. His body rose and fell in sync with the flickering streetlights flashing through the car window. Except for the brief moment of passing beneath the bridge—where their paths overlapped because of the terrain—he shared nothing with the present moment. In fact, he had no relation to anything beyond the shell of the car. The thing most closely connected to him was on the far side: the instant when someone in a residential building switched off the living room light.

The people at home all hated the way he opened the door late at night. The grinding sound of the metal gate sliding back and forth repeated day after day. These invisible reproaches carried over into the next morning, waking up, moving, surviving through movement, and moving again toward another place—like a bridge, a bridge made entirely of bridges. His knees ached as he climbed up and down four flights of stairs; with each step, the vibration traveled through his body like tires bouncing over asphalt and striking his shoulders. He was not even connected to himself.

If one day this driver were to meet this moment on the bridge, occupying the same plane of time, perhaps the first thing he would feel would be a complete unfamiliarity with each other’s ways of moving.
