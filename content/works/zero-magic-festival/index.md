**第零屆法術節 / The Zeroth Magic Festival**  

作品名稱：第零屆法術節

創作年代：2017

材質：紙、樹脂

作品尺寸：依場地而定

我使用紙製作了一尊台灣歷史上著名的獨裁者蔣介石的紙製塑像，並邀請道士陳柏瑜為其進行招魂的儀式。儀式完成後，我邀請兩名在台灣廟會上表演的舞者，在塑像面前完成一段舞蹈，就像台灣傳統儀式裡，表演給神明看的表演一樣。
儘管蔣介石在台灣進行了多年的白色恐怖統治，但如今台灣民眾仍普遍對其過去的作為並無太明確的認識，並對其形象仍存在貨幣之上亦大多沒有太多感觸。
在嘲諷蔣介石的威權遺緒仍如幽魂一般繚繞在台灣之外，這件作品不單是對宗教儀式的模仿，而是對權力關係如何透過「儀式」這件事潛入日常的一次檢測。


Year: 2017

Materials: Paper, resin

Dimensions: Variable

For this work, I created a life-sized paper sculpture of Chiang Kai-shek, the authoritarian
leader who once ruled Taiwan, and invited Taoist priest Chen Po-Yu to perform a ritual
of spirit invocation upon it. After the ritual was completed, two dancers—both active
performers in Taiwanese temple festivals—were invited to dance before the statue,
echoing the traditional practice of performing for deities in folk religious ceremonies.
Although Chiang Kai-shek’s regime imposed decades of White Terror in Taiwan, public
awareness of his political violence remains limited. His image, still present on banknotes
and monuments, has become largely desensitized—emptied of emotional resonance,
yet persisting as a normalized symbol.
By summoning this political figure through the language of ritual, The 0th Kuandu Magic
Festival satirically confronts the lingering ghost of authoritarianism that continues to
hover over Taiwan’s collective consciousness. The work is not merely an imitation of a
religious ceremony, but an examination of how structures of power infiltrate everyday
life through the mechanisms of ritual—where belief, spectacle, and authority are
constantly reproduced under the guise of tradition.
